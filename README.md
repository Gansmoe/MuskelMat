# MuskelMat

## Bundler

-> Parcel is used for bundling and transpiling.

## Install

-> Clone repo <br>
-> In terminal, navigate to MuskelMat-folder <br>
-> run 'npm ci' 

## Start

-> run 'npm start' <br>
-> your browser should open automatically <br>
-> to get to app, click the 'App' button in index.html <br>


## Problems right now

-> The logic to get a complete weekly menu isn't written yet. <br>
-> When app is run from index.html it lands on a "not-valid"-route and responds with a "nothing here message". <br>
-> There is nothing indicating that a recipe has been added even thou it is. <br>
-> The button for erasing recipes from saved recipes is still there when you clicked it. <br>
