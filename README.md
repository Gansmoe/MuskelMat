# MuskelMat

## Install

-> Clone repo
-> In terminal, navigate to MuskelMat-folder
-> run 'npm ci'

## Start

-> run 'npm start'
-> your browser should open automatically
-> to get to app, click the 'App' button in index.html


## Problems right now

-> The logic to get a complete weekly menu isn't written yet.
-> When app is run from index.html it lands on a "not-valid"-route and responds with a "nothing here message".
-> There is nothing indicating that a recipe has been added even thou it is.
-> The button for erasing recipes from saved recipes is still there when you clicked it.
